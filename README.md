# Robotics Fleet Management

Advanced AMR/AGV fleet orchestration and robot task assignment with intelligent path planning, collision avoidance, battery management, and real-time fleet coordination.

## Overview

The Robotics Fleet Management service is a mission-critical component of the Paklog WMS/WES platform, providing centralized orchestration and control for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). This service enables warehouse automation at scale, coordinating fleets of 100+ robots to maximize throughput while ensuring safety and efficiency.

Modern warehouses are rapidly adopting robotics to handle repetitive tasks, increase picking rates, and reduce labor costs. This service provides the intelligent orchestration layer required to coordinate robot movements, assign tasks optimally, manage battery charging cycles, and prevent collisions in dynamic warehouse environments.

## Domain-Driven Design

### Bounded Context

The Robotics Fleet Management bounded context is responsible for:
